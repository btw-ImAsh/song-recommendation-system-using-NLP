# Song Recommendation System Using NLP

This project aims to recommend songs based on the similarity of their textual metadataâ€”such as lyrics, genres, tags, or descriptions. By transforming text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF and comparing them using cosine similarity, the system finds and ranks songs that are most similar to a given input song.
## Tech Stack

- **Excel:** For data exploration.

- **Python:** For data preprocessing.

- **Pandas/Matplotlib/SckitiLearn:** Libraries for further data manupulation, cleaning and machine learning.

- **NLTK/re:** For texual operations.

- **Streamlit:** For frontend and UI.

## Workflow

1. Data Collection:

Contains song metadata such as title, artist, genre, and lyrics.
Example fields used: Song Title, Artist, Lyrics, Genre.

2. Preprocessing:

Cleaning the text (removal of stop words, punctuation, lowercasing). Combining relevant features into a single textual field (e.g., lyrics + genre).

3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorization):

Use a TfidfVectorizer to convert the text messages into numerical feature vectors based on the importance of each word.

This converts raw text into a sparse matrix of TF-IDF scores.

4. Cosine similarity:

Calculates similarity scores between the input song and all other songs.

Higher score = more similar.

5. Recommendation Engine:

Takes a song as input (by title or index).
Returns top-N most similar songs based on cosine similarity.
